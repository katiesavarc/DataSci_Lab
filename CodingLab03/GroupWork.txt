Group work:

Ingrid Gendron(260797713): Coded the grid plot functions, and the function to generate
the data.

Noah LeFrancois(260706235): Coded the histogram function as well as the rescaling function when 
we change distances.

Katie Savard(260678183): Calculated the standard deviation and made the plots for STD as
function of distance.

As a team: We all troubleshooted the final merged code as well as wrote the final 
delieverables(The final plots as well as the two text files). We also reviewed each others
code via github on pull requests.
