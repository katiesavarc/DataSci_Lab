== M&Ms ==
2/2 correct algebraic form for likelihood p(d|b). No need for combinatorical prefactor.

3/4 prior p(b)
	2/2 working code
        Why are you excluding b = 0 or b = 1?
	1/2 for the prior not having unphysical things (e.g., no negative values for b and no values greater than 1)
        Although you implicitly assume 0 < b < 1, your code does not handle that correctly.

11/11 plotting distributions
	3/3 prior
	3/3 likelihood
	3/3 posterior
	2/2 normalizing posterior

6/6 combining data
	2/2 prior
	2/2 likelihood
	2/2 posterior

1/5 comparing the two methods 
	0/2 saying that the two methods give the same answer
	1/2 showing the graph
	0/1 saying that more data -> narrower posterior.

2/2 a reasonable conclusion regarding which M&Ms factory.

4/4 n% credible region code that works!
    See solution for much easier code

== Radioactive source ==
3/3 correct likelihood for p(x| lambda)

8/12 
	1/3 likelihood
	1/3 posterior
	3/3 prior
	3/3 series of sensible graphs (including things like proper axis labels etc.)
        You didn't find it weird to have null probability distribution for N > 30?

3/6
	1/2 after 10 measurements
	1/2 after 50
	1/2 after 99
        May have been good if you're posteriors were ok; hard to tell.
