4/4: Two tests. For each test, one point for a reasonable thing to test and another point for correct implementation

3/3: Read in data, re-centered, and converted units for x, y, and yerr

3/3: Properly sampled priors using numpy (correct bounds, adequately dense sampling with at least ~75 points along each axis)
3/3: Correct implementation of "posterior" equation

3/3: Correctly marginalized over all parameters but epsilon

2/2: Well formatted plots for marginalized distributions for epsilon (axis labels)

2/2: Well formatted contour plot for alpha vs beta (axis and colour bar labels)

4/4: Well formatted MAP plots (labels, errorbars, reasonable fits)

2/2: Correctly computed evidences
2/2: Compared evidences and commented on which model was preferred
