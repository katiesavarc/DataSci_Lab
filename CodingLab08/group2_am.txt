4/4 Q1
    2/2 Correctly inputted values (subtract 1 for excessively rounded numbers).
    2/2 Correct exoplanet transit lightcurve (subtract 1 if there isn’t ~30 minutes on either side of the transit; doesn’t have to be super exact)

6/6 Q2
    2/2 Correctly coding up the Planck function.
    1/1 Integrating and multiply by pi*r^2 correctly.
    2/2 Correct light curve
    1/1 Saying that the eclipse depth is smaller than the transit depth

6/6 Q3
    3/3 Minimization
        1/1 Updating the correct parameters
        1/1 Computing the mean-square goodness of fit
        1/1 Actual optimization
    3/3 Lightcurves
        2/2 1 for each curve
        1/1 Being generally correct

41/42 Q4
    2/2 New planet
        2/2 Correctly inputted values (subtract 1 for excessively rounded numbers).
    2/2 Detector sensitivity
        2/2 Polynomial function (ok to use scipy; order of polynomial terms doesn’t matter)
    4/4 Exoplanet signal
        4/4 Function
            1/1 Correct inputs
            1/1 Correct parameter updates
            1/1 Compute new light curve
            1/1 Computing and multiplying detector calibration function
    9/9 Prior, Likelihood, Posterior
        4/4 Prior
            1/1 point Updating planet parameters
            1/1 Checking rp
            1/1 Checking L
            1/1 point Returning 0 vs -np.inf
        3/3 Likelihood
            2/2 Correct log likelihood
            1/1 Generating model correctly by feeding into previous function correctly
        2/2 Posterior
            1/1 All necessary inputs
            1/1 Combining prior and likelihood appropriately
    2/2 Running MCMC (1 for each MCMC run)
    11/11 Looking at results
        1/1 Log probability plot
        6/6
            2/2 Median values
            2/2 + errors
            2/2 – errors; because of the randomness of MCMC, values don’t need to match exactly, but should be close
        2/2 Plot comparison of uncalibrated data + uncalibrated model
        2/2 Plot comparison of calibrated data + model
    2/2 Phasecurve peak
        1/1 Correct offset
        1/1 Saying winds blow to the west
    2/2 Temperatures (1 for each correctly computed temperature)
    7/8 Dayside and Nightside temperatures
        3.5/4 Dayside
            1/1 Plugging in values from chains into inversePlanck
            0.5/1 Histogram
            1/1 68% credibility region
            1/1 95% credibility region
        3.5/4 Nightside
            1/1 Plugging in values from chains into inversePlanck
